## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework

### What I learned

This is the first React project I've made on my own. I learned how to use it with Tailwind CSS framework, and I also just generally learned how to work with it in general. I also learned how to serve the files locally. 

I was also pleased with my focus on mobile-first development throughout this project. 

### Continued development

I wish to keep working with React and Tailwind CSS.
